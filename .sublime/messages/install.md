Thank you for choosing `print`
------------------------------

print generates a preview for printing your Sublime Text code.

* Markdown can be opened in a
  [mini-HTML](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/minihtml.html)
  preview within Sublime Text
* Code is previewed in your default browser for printing

Look for `Print: Preview ...` in:

* the command palette
* or the context menu (right-click)

Known issues
------------

* the Markdown Preview is limited to
  [mini-HTML](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/minihtml.html)
    * HTML comments break the preview (at that point)
* mdpopups uses PythonMarkdown which uses 4 spaces for indentation
